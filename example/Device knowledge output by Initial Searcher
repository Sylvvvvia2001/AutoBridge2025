[Github code for Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color)]
This discussion in the homeassistant-powercalc repository mentions the Yeelight YLDP13YL 8.5W Smart LED
Bulb 1S. A user requested the addition of a LUT for this specific bulb, and it was added to the repository. This tool
helps in calculating the power consumption of smart bulbs, including the Yeelight models, within Home Assistant.
Yeelink/Yeelight Devices for Home Assistant
https://github.com/bramstroker/homeassistant-powercalc/discussions/288
This repository provides integration for Yeelink/Yeelight devices, including various Yeelight smart lights, for
Home Assistant. While the repository does not explicitly list the Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color) model, it supports a
wide range of Yeelight devices. It could potentially be compatible or provide a useful starting point for integrating
Yeelight devices with Home Assistant. These resources offer a starting point for integrating Yeelight smart bulbs
with Home Assistant, either through power consumption calculation or direct device control via the Yeelink
integration.

[APIs and SDKs for Yeelight LED Bulb 1S (Color)]
Yeelight 3rd-party Control Protocol
This protocol is designed for developers and IoT enthusiasts, enabling the development of applications that can
discover and control Yeelight WiFi devices within the same LAN. It uses a SSDP-like discovery mechanism and
JSON encoded commands. It’s important to note that all messages defined in this protocol are not encrypted,
which means the security of Yeelight devices relies on the router’s security level.
YeeLight Python Library
The YeeLight Python library facilitates control over Yeelight RGB LED bulbs via WiFi. While it does not support
some features of the Yeelight API, like discovery, it is comprehensive for most control needs. The library allows
for discovering bulbs on your network, and controlling their state, brightness, color, and more. It also supports
effects, which control how the bulb transitions between states, and provides a way to listen for real-time state
updates from the bulb.
